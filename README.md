**This project was completed in four stages:**

+ Activating and utilizing the laptop's built-in camera.
+ Designing, preparing, and overlaying the keyboard image onto the camera feed.
+ Using the MediaPipe library to detect finger movements and measure distances between fingertips.
+ Outputting the results as typed words.

**Note:**
To enhance the system's performance and accuracy, a supplementary camera can be employed for depth perception and dimensional measurements.
The secondary camera should be oriented orthogonally to the primary camera.
